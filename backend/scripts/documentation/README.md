# Documentation Scripts

Educational and demonstration scripts that explain system concepts and provide setup examples.

## Scripts Overview

### Logic Demonstrations
- **`demonstrate_temporal_logic.py`** - Interactive demonstration of temporal data handling logic
- **`temporal_strategy_explanation.py`** - Comprehensive explanation of temporal alignment strategies

### System Setup Examples  
- **`setup_monitoring_alerts.sh`** - Example monitoring and alerting system configuration

### Examples Directory
- **`examples/`** - Reserved for usage examples and tutorials

## Purpose

These scripts serve educational and documentation purposes:

### `demonstrate_temporal_logic.py`
**Educational demonstration of how the system handles temporal data alignment**
- Shows date range calculations
- Demonstrates gap detection logic
- Explains temporal interpolation strategies
- Interactive examples with real scenarios

### `temporal_strategy_explanation.py` 
**Comprehensive guide to temporal data handling strategies**
- Documents different temporal alignment approaches
- Explains the rationale behind temporal decisions
- Provides examples of complex temporal scenarios
- Reference for understanding system behavior

### `setup_monitoring_alerts.sh`
**Example monitoring system configuration**
- Demonstrates how to set up system monitoring
- Shows alerting configuration examples
- Provides templates for production monitoring
- Documents best practices for system health monitoring

## Usage Patterns

### Learning the System
```bash
# Understand temporal logic
python scripts/documentation/demonstrate_temporal_logic.py

# Learn temporal strategies
python scripts/documentation/temporal_strategy_explanation.py
```

### Setting Up Monitoring
```bash
# Configure monitoring (example)
./scripts/documentation/setup_monitoring_alerts.sh
```

### Code Documentation
These scripts serve as:
- **Living Documentation**: Code that explains system concepts
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Hands-on learning tools
- **Reference Implementation**: Examples of best practices
- **Onboarding Material**: Help new developers understand the system

## Educational Value

### For New Developers
- Understand complex temporal data handling
- Learn system architecture through examples
- See monitoring and operational best practices
- Get hands-on experience with ocean data concepts

### For System Operators
- Learn monitoring setup procedures
- Understand system health indicators
- See alerting configuration examples
- Reference operational best practices

### For Researchers
- Understand data temporal alignment
- Learn about data quality considerations
- See examples of ocean data handling
- Reference scientific data management practices

## Best Practices

1. **Interactive Learning**: Run demonstration scripts to understand concepts
2. **Reference Material**: Use as documentation for system behavior
3. **Template Usage**: Adapt monitoring examples for production use
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep examples current with system changes
5. **Educational Focus**: Prioritize clarity over performance in these scripts

These documentation scripts bridge the gap between technical implementation and conceptual understanding, making the ocean data platform more accessible to developers, operators, and researchers.
